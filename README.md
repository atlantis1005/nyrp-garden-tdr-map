# NYRP Transferrable Development Rights (TDR) Potential Map 
## And final project for Advanced GIS
Creating a map for [New York Restoration Project](https://www.nyrp.org/en/) (a NYC garden non-profit) which is my capstone team's client. 
NYRP approached the our capstone team with a proposal to create a resource package that would help prepare the organization for future [Transferable Development Rights (TDR)](https://fontanarchitecture.com/air-rights-nyc/) 
transactions with private entities. One of our deliverables was a database on Google Sheet with garden locations, 
relevant zoning information as well as information about the abutting properties for the purpose of better understanding what potential development rights transactions may arise.
For my Advanced GIS project, I wanted to see how best to represent some of that data spatially. 

This project shows a soft site analysis for the abutting lots surrounding each garden and provides information about how much transferrable square footage a garden can transfer to a site.
