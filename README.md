# NYRP Transferrable Development Rights (TDR) Potential Map 
## Also in-progress final project for Advanced GIS
Creating a map for [New York Restoration Project](https://www.nyrp.org/en/) (a NYC garden non-profit) which is my capstone team's client. 
NYRP approached the our capstone team with a proposal to create a resource package that would help prepare the organization for future [Transferable Development Rights (TDR)](https://fontanarchitecture.com/air-rights-nyc/) 
transactions with private entities. One of our deliverables was a database on Google Sheet with garden locations, 
relevant zoning information as well as information about the abutting properties for the purpose of better understanding what potential development rights transactions may arise.
For my Advanced GIS project, I wanted to see how best to represent some of that data spatially. 

**What is working now?**

I used a series of buttons to fly to all of the garden locations.
Most gardens have a tax lot layer and only some of the Abutting Properties (using MapPluto & coordinates to create polygons in QGIS has been tedious)

**What should be working soon?**

Buttons that toggle different views that will show different layer colors for the abutting properties associated with variables related to Built FAR & how much square footage can be transferred
A legend appears with the toggled layers
